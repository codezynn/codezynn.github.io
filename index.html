    <h1>Hi, Babe.</h1>
     src="scripts.js"></script>
    <p>Happy 4th month to us! I want you to know that I am happy that we are on our fourth month already. It was just like nine weeks ago when we celebrated our second month and now we're on our fourth. It's like time flies by so fast and in c couple of months, we're down to our sixth, and soon, we'll be celebrating our anniversary. I'm not complaining though. I just want you to know how happy I am with you. Like genuinely happy, babe.</p>

  <p>	Since you came, you made everything better and I wouldn't trade this for anything else because with you, I'm happy. I'm all good. I know I have said this a million times to you but if everything has been stripped off of me and I get to choose one thing or person that I'd like to keep, it's going to be you. Always you. I want you to know that I love you so much more than the bad days ahead of us. Bad days can come and go but my love for you will always be constant. </p>

    <p> I won't make this long because I have a handwritten letter ready for you. </p>

    <p>	I love you so much, Mmarie Angela Santos-Tan. </p>

  <p>	Again, Happy 4th monthsary, babe! </p>
